                Although he’s not blessed with silky skills at his feet, Damien
                has taken up the challenge of The Gaffer at Football Funder
                after more than a decade spent at consumer tech businesses that
                have disrupted traditional industries. <br />
                <br />
                As employee number one with e-cigarette firm SKYCIG (acquired in
                2013 and rebranded to Blu), he gained Advertising Standards
                Agency approval to air the first legal vaping television advert
                in Europe, and persuaded Premier League clubs to advertise
                vaping products on pitchside ads during matches for the first
                time. <br />
                <br />
                Damien helped drive the hyper-growth of Uber in the UK as
                Operations & Logistics Manager from 2015-19, before developing
                OYO Hotels & Homes UK portfolio. Most recently, Damien was Head
                of Operations at used car retailer Cazoo, responsible for a team
                of 350 people, scaling their click and collect operation to
                account for over 70% of total sales volumes.
                <br />
                <br /> Originally from Scotland, he supports Rangers FC, and now
                resides in County Durham with his fiancée Jen and their twin
                boys, Jude and Cameron.
